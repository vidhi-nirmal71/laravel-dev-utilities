  <!-- <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Laravel 9 to 11: Upgrade Guide + Real Risks You’re Ignoring</h2> -->

  <p>
    Pause for a moment. Imagine waking up one morning to a security breach traced back to an outdated framework, or discovering that half of your must-have plugins no longer work—leaving your team scrambling as clients and users quietly vanish.
    Sound extreme? Maybe not. Because if you're still running Laravel 6.x in 2025, you're not just behind—you're skating at the edge of serious risk and missed opportunity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t just another Laravel upgrade. It's the difference between thriving and surviving in a fast-moving web world.
    <strong>Skip this upgrade, and your project might become the next cautionary tale.</strong>
  </p>

  <h4>Upgrade or Fall Behind: The High Cost of Missing Laravel 11.x</h4>
  <p>
    Don’t fall into the trap of “good enough.” Skipping the upgrade means missing out on the innovations, defenses, and performance standards shaping tomorrow’s web landscape.
    Today’s leaders are on 11.x—don’t wake up to find your business left behind, your users gone, or your team rebuilding from disaster.
  </p>

  <h4>Risk Alert: The Hidden Dangers of Postponing Your Laravel Upgrade</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Critical Security Patches:</strong> Every day on 6.x is another vulnerability open to attackers.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Leaps:</strong> Modern PHP and Laravel releases turbocharge your app’s speed and scalability.</li>
    <li><strong>Package Compatibility:</strong> Most plugins require Laravel 9, 10, or 11. Stay compatible or face “composer update” chaos.</li>
    <li><strong>Dev Satisfaction & Hiring Power:</strong> Developers avoid legacy code. Modern stacks attract top talent.</li>
    <li><strong>Smooth Upgrade Pathways:</strong> The longer you wait, the harder and more expensive the upgrade becomes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Face the Truth: Lagging Brings Real Consequences</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Unpatched code makes your app a target.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Drag:</strong> Older PHP and Laravel versions slow your stack.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocked Features:</strong> Breeze, Jetstream, and modern features are off-limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Efficiency:</strong> Legacy bugs and slow workflows kill innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Growing Complexity:</strong> Every skipped version adds risk, rewrites, and gotchas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>The Clock Is Ticking: Start Your Laravel Upgrade Now or Pay the Price Later</h4>
  <p>Here’s what smart teams do before disaster strikes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Read the official docs:</strong> From 6.x to 11.x, every step is documented.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare (and test!) full backups:</strong> Never upgrade without a safety net.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit your dependencies:</strong> Replace or patch outdated packages.</li>
    <li><strong>Test, test, and test again:</strong> Catch issues before your users do.</li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade incrementally:</strong> One version at a time reduces risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Don’t Just Take Our Word - See the Real Stories</h4>
  <p>
    Teams that succeeded in upgrading from 6.x to 11.x:
    <ul>
      <li> Adapted to changes in auth, job batching, and service providers.</li>
      <li> Rewrote custom middleware and replaced abandoned packages.</li>
      <li> Gained faster tests, fewer emergencies, and reduced tech debt.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>The Secret Weapon: The Official Documentation</h4>
  <p>
    Every headache, every pitfall—someone’s documented it. The modern Laravel docs walk you through each upgrade step with examples and checklists.
